# peppol-yellow-pages
The official PEPPOL Yellow Pages (PYP) software. It is split into the following sub-projects:
  * `peppol-yellow-pages-api` - the common API for the indexer and the publisher
  * `peppol-yellow-pages-indexer` - the PYP indexer web application
  * `peppol-yellow-pages-publisher` - the PYP publisher web application
  
This project was started on 2015-08-31 so don't expect too mush right now :)
  
# Building requirements
To build the PYP software you need at least Java 1.8 and Apache Maven 3.x.
